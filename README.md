My passion for problem-solving and complex architectures is what led me to my studies in computing. I have a strong presence around public speaking and leadership and have demonstrated them throughout my college studies, industry placement and personal experience. I am very open to feedback and adapting my own interpersonal skills, development skills, knowledge of the area, collaboration skills, working as a team or individually on projects.
